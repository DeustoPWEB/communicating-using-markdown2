## Step 1: Create a Task List

A task list creates checkboxes that can be checked off by people with access <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#collaborator)</sup> in a repository. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests.

If you include a task list in the first comment of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list.

Watch out! The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render properly.

#### Example markup

```
- [x] Additional markup is supported, including @mentions, #referencess, [links](url), **emphasis**, and <del>HTML tags</del>.
- [x] List syntax is required.
  - You can nest lists below, too!
- [x] This item is completed.
- [ ] This item is not complete.
```
